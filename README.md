# Google-Beta 1998 version Clone  
> * This repo contains _Google-1998_ version clone.  
> * This is the first homework for [CSS](https://app.patika.dev/moduller/css) module in [patika.dev](https://app.patika.dev/).  
> * There is a web archive called the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) that contains all the websites on the internet.  
> * I reviewed the first version of [Google](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) using [Google 1998](https://web.archive.org/web/19981202230410if_/http://www.google.com/).  
> * I used for an [icon](https://web.archive.org/web/19990504112211im_/http://www.google.com/google.jpg) while creating this page.  
> * I used _HTML_ tags such as button, link, a, p, article, footer for page content.  
> * For _CSS_, I made assignments (such as padding, margin, background color, font-size) using the id and class names that I gave to the HTML tags.
